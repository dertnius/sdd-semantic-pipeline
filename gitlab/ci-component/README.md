# ci-components

Shared **GitLab CI/CD Components** for the enterprise org, importable by **any project
on the GitLab instance** via `include: component:`. Currently three components:

- **`python-nexus`** — the base layer: a stock `python:3.x-slim` from the Nexus registry,
  pip on the Nexus proxy, and a runtime pandoc install. Compose it into your own jobs.
- **`docx-to-chunks`** — a turnkey pipeline that converts a repo of Word documents
  (incl. legacy `.doc` via a Windows+Office stage) into semantic chunks + a lexical index.
- **`validate-skills`** — an offline CI gate that validates **Agent Skills** (`SKILL.md`)
  against the Agent Skills open standard; no pip/pandoc/GitHub, just a Python image.

## `python-nexus`

Bootstraps a CI job on a **stock `python:3.x-slim` pulled from the enterprise Nexus
Docker registry**, with pip pinned to the **Nexus PyPI proxy** and an optional
**runtime pandoc install** from a Nexus raw repo — so a project needs **no custom
container image**. It provides:

- `default: image:` → `${NEXUS_DOCKER_REGISTRY}/python:<python_version>-slim`
- `default: cache:` → the pip wheel cache + a version-keyed pandoc-binary cache
- `variables:` → `PIP_INDEX_URL` (Nexus proxy), `PIP_CACHE_DIR`,
  `PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK`, `PANDOC_VERSION`
- two hidden `before_script` fragments you compose with `!reference`:
  - `.nexus-pip-bootstrap` — upgrade pip (resolves from the Nexus proxy)
  - `.nexus-install-pandoc` — fetch + cache pandoc ≥ 3 on PATH (stdlib `urllib`, no curl/apt)

### Inputs

| Input | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `python_version` | `3.11` | the `python:<ver>-slim` Nexus image tag |
| `pandoc_version` | `3.5` | keys the pandoc binary cache; pair with `NEXUS_PANDOC_URL` |

---

## `docx-to-chunks`

A **turnkey** pipeline a docs repo includes to turn a folder of Word documents into
**semantic chunks + a model-free lexical index** — no Python knowledge required. It is
**self-contained** (it inlines the `python-nexus` essentials rather than nesting a
component include, which would need the instance-specific `<group>` path).

```
prepare (.doc -> .docx, Windows+Word)  ->  convert (docx -> md + lint)
  ->  chunks (export + index --lexical)  ->  publish (chunks + index artifact)
```

The pipeline reads OOXML `.docx` only, so legacy binary `.doc` is converted first on a
**Windows runner with Microsoft Word** (via Word COM). If that runner has no Word, the job
**fails with guidance** to convert locally with
[`scripts/convert-doc-to-docx.ps1`](scripts/convert-doc-to-docx.ps1) and commit the `.docx`.
When there are no `.doc` files the prepare job is a no-op; set `convert_legacy_doc: false`
to skip it entirely (all-`.docx` repos with no Windows runner).

### Inputs

| Input | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `pipeline_install` | `sdd-pipeline[lang]` | pip spec for the pipeline (Nexus proxy), or a `git+https://…@<tag>` spec |
| `lang` | `de` | enrichment language (`de`/`en`/`fr`/`it`/`auto`) |
| `merge_mode` | `prose` | `prose`→`--merge-prose`, `definitions`→`--merge-definitions`, `none`→neither |
| `convert_legacy_doc` | `true` | run the Windows `.doc`→`.docx` job (set `false` for all-`.docx`/no-Windows) |
| `windows_runner_tags` | `["windows","office"]` | tags selecting the Windows shell runner with Word |
| `python_version` | `3.11` | `python:<ver>-slim` Nexus image tag (Linux jobs) |
| `pandoc_version` | `3.5` | keys the pandoc binary cache; pair with `NEXUS_PANDOC_URL` |

---

## `validate-skills`

An **offline** CI gate that validates **Agent Skills** (`SKILL.md`) against the
[Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io/specification) — the same idea as
[`gitlab-ci-skill`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/gitlab-ci-skill)'s own pipeline,
but **self-contained**: instead of `git fetch`-ing the upstream `agentskills` validator
from github.com at run time (unreliable behind a proxy / air-gap), it validates with an
**inline, stdlib-only Python checker** — no pip, no pandoc, no Nexus proxy, no GitHub. The
checks mirror this repo's own `check_copilot.py` C6 (`check_skills`): a present/terminated
`---` frontmatter block; a `name` that is present, equals its directory, matches the
lowercase-letters/digits/hyphens grammar (no leading/trailing/double hyphen) and is
`<= 64` chars; and a present `description` of `<= 1024` chars. The `validate:skills` job
fails the pipeline on any problem and writes a `skill-validation-report.txt` artifact.

```
validate (validate:skills — inline stdlib-Python check of every SKILL.md)
```

### Inputs

| Input | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `skills_dir` | `.claude/skills` | dir holding `<name>/SKILL.md` skill folders (e.g. `.claude/skills`, `.github/skills`, `.agents/skills`) |
| `image` | `${NEXUS_DOCKER_REGISTRY}/python:3.11-slim` | container image with a Python 3 interpreter; non-Nexus consumers override with e.g. `python:3.11-slim` |
| `fail_on_empty` | `true` | fail if no `SKILL.md` is found under `skills_dir` (catches a misconfigured path) |

Unlike the other two components, `validate-skills` needs **no** `NEXUS_*` plumbing when a
consumer sets `image` to a public Python image — it installs nothing.

## Using `python-nexus` in *your* project

### Prerequisites (one-time, per org/group — ask your platform team)

The component reads three **group-level CI/CD variables**, inherited by every project in
the group. They must be set once (Group → Settings → CI/CD → Variables); you do **not**
re-declare them per project:

| Variable | Example |
|---|---|
| `NEXUS_DOCKER_REGISTRY` | `nexus.corp.example.com:8891` |
| `NEXUS_PYPI_INDEX_URL` | `https://nexus.corp.example.com/repository/pypi-group/simple/` |
| `NEXUS_PANDOC_URL` | `https://nexus.corp.example.com/repository/raw-hosted/pandoc/pandoc-3.5-1-amd64.deb` |

If your project lives in a different group, either set them on your group too or ask for
them to be defined at the instance level. `NEXUS_PANDOC_URL` is only needed by jobs that
use `.nexus-install-pandoc`.

### How it works (mental model)

`include: component:` merges the component into your pipeline **before** it runs. After the
merge, the component's `default: image`/`default: cache`, its `variables:`, and the two
hidden fragments are part of *your* pipeline — the fragments behave exactly like hidden
jobs you wrote yourself, so `!reference [.nexus-pip-bootstrap, before_script]` just works.
You add the `include:` once and opt each job into the bootstrap it needs.

### Scenario 1 — pure-Python job, pip only (no pandoc)

The common case: lint/test a Python package. You get the Nexus image + pip-on-Nexus for free.

```yaml
include:
  - component: $CI_SERVER_FQDN/<group>/ci-components/python-nexus@1.0.0

test:
  before_script:
    - !reference [.nexus-pip-bootstrap, before_script]
    - pip install -e ".[dev]"       # resolves from the Nexus PyPI proxy
  script:
    - pytest
```

No `image:` line needed — the component's `default: image` supplies it. No `inputs:` needed
— `python_version` defaults to `3.11`.

### Scenario 2 — a job that also needs pandoc

Add the second fragment. It installs pandoc ≥ 3 on PATH (cached after the first run), so any
tool that shells out to `pandoc` finds it.

```yaml
docs:
  before_script:
    - !reference [.nexus-pip-bootstrap, before_script]
    - !reference [.nexus-install-pandoc, before_script]
    - pip install -e ".[docs]"
  script:
    - mytool-that-uses-pandoc build
```

Only add `.nexus-install-pandoc` to the jobs that actually need pandoc — keep it off
lint/test jobs so they stay fast.

### Scenario 3 — choose Python / pandoc versions

Override the inputs at include time (they shape the image tag and the pandoc cache key):

```yaml
include:
  - component: $CI_SERVER_FQDN/<group>/ci-components/python-nexus@1.0.0
    inputs:
      python_version: "3.12"     # → python:3.12-slim from Nexus
      pandoc_version: "3.5"      # must match the binary at NEXUS_PANDOC_URL
```

`pandoc_version` only keys the cache — make sure `NEXUS_PANDOC_URL` points at that pandoc
build. To matrix over Python versions, include the component twice in separate config files,
or use `parallel:matrix` with a per-job `image:` override (Scenario 5).

### Scenario 4 — add a project-specific cache (important gotcha)

The component sets the pip + pandoc caches under **`default: cache`**. GitLab's rule: a job
that declares its **own** `cache:` **replaces** `default.cache` for that job (caches do not
merge). So if a job needs an extra cache (e.g. a model/download dir), **re-list the shared
entries** so you don't lose pip/pandoc caching:

```yaml
variables:
  PIP_CACHE_DIR: "$CI_PROJECT_DIR/.cache/pip"   # already set by the component; shown for clarity

train:
  cache:
    - { key: "pip-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG",  paths: [.cache/pip] }   # keep the component's pip cache
    - { key: "pandoc-$PANDOC_VERSION",   paths: [.cache/bin] }   # keep the component's pandoc cache
    - { key: "models-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG", paths: [.cache/models] }  # your extra cache
  before_script:
    - !reference [.nexus-pip-bootstrap, before_script]
    - pip install -e ".[ml]"
  script:
    - python train.py
```

If you set a **top-level** `cache:` in your `.gitlab-ci.yml`, it overrides the component's
`default.cache` for the *whole* pipeline — usually not what you want. Prefer per-job caches.

### Scenario 5 — override the image for one job

The component's image is a `default:`, so any job can override it locally without affecting
the rest:

```yaml
build-wheels:
  image: "${NEXUS_DOCKER_REGISTRY}/python:3.11"   # full (non-slim) image for this job only
  before_script:
    - !reference [.nexus-pip-bootstrap, before_script]
  script:
    - python -m build
```

### Pinning & upgrades

| Pin | Resolves to | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `@1.0.0` | exact release | **production** (recommended) — reproducible |
| `@1` | latest `1.x` | auto-pick patches/minors within a major |
| `@~latest` | latest published release | always-newest (accepts churn) |
| `@<branch>` / `@<sha>` | unreleased revision | testing a component change before it's tagged |

Pin to an exact tag in production and bump deliberately. A component change is a new tag in
`ci-components`; consumers adopt it by editing one `@<version>` line.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Pipeline pulls `python` from Docker Hub / `401 Unauthorized` on the image | `NEXUS_DOCKER_REGISTRY` not set on your group, or its value doesn't match the registry host:port |
| `pip` reaches `pypi.org` instead of Nexus / TLS errors | `NEXUS_PYPI_INDEX_URL` unset, or Nexus uses an internal CA — set `PIP_TRUSTED_HOST` (or trust the corp CA) |
| `.nexus-install-pandoc` fails to download | `NEXUS_PANDOC_URL` unset or pointing at a missing artifact; verify the URL is reachable from a runner |
| `!reference [.nexus-pip-bootstrap, …]` "could not be found" | the `include: component:` line is missing, or the component address/`@version` is wrong |
| `@1.0.0` not found | that version isn't published in the Catalog yet — publish/tag it first, or pin a branch/SHA to test |

> Validate your `.gitlab-ci.yml` before pushing: open it in the GitLab **Pipeline Editor →
> Validate**, and check the **Merged YAML** tab — it should show the component's
> `default.image`/`default.cache`, its `variables:`, and the two hidden jobs inlined.

## Using `docx-to-chunks` in *your* project

The whole pipeline is the component — a consuming **docs** repo needs only an `include:`
and its documents under `inbox/`.

### Prerequisites

| Prerequisite | Notes |
|---|---|
| Group CI/CD variables `NEXUS_DOCKER_REGISTRY` / `NEXUS_PYPI_INDEX_URL` / `NEXUS_PANDOC_URL` | same as `python-nexus` (see above). |
| The pipeline package installable from Nexus | publish `sdd-pipeline` to a Nexus-hosted PyPI repo in the proxy group, **or** point `pipeline_install` at a `git+https://…/sdd-semantic-pipeline.git@<tag>` spec. |
| A Windows runner with **Microsoft Word**, tagged to match `windows_runner_tags` | **only** when `convert_legacy_doc: true` and `.doc` files are present. No such runner? See the local fallback below. |

> ⚠️ **The Windows runner must use the `shell` executor running as a logged-in user**
> (autologon / interactive desktop), **not** a service or `SYSTEM` account. Word COM
> automation hangs without an interactive desktop session — this is a Word limitation, not
> a pipeline bug. The job sets `timeout: 30m` as a backstop so a hang (incl. a
> password-protected `.doc`, which prompts for a password) fails the job rather than running
> to the global timeout. Unprotect protected `.doc` files before converting.

### The whole consuming pipeline

```yaml
# docs-repo/.gitlab-ci.yml
include:
  - component: $CI_SERVER_FQDN/<group>/ci-components/docx-to-chunks@1.0.0
    inputs:
      lang: "de"
```

Commit `.doc`/`.docx` under `inbox/` (subfolders allowed) and push. The chunks + lexical
index land as the `publish` job's `chunks-<sha>` artifact (`outbox/chunks/`, `outbox/index/`,
`outbox/reports/`), 30-day retention.

### All `.docx` already, or no Windows runner

Skip the Windows stage entirely:

```yaml
    inputs:
      convert_legacy_doc: false
```

If you *do* have `.doc` but no Windows+Word runner, convert them locally first with the
canonical script, then commit the `.docx`:

```powershell
pwsh ./convert-doc-to-docx.ps1 -InboxDir inbox -Recurse   # needs Microsoft Word on Windows
git add inbox; git commit -m "convert .doc -> .docx"; git push
```

(The script is [`scripts/convert-doc-to-docx.ps1`](scripts/convert-doc-to-docx.ps1) in this
component repo — the same logic the CI Windows job runs. It is a **no-op** when no `.doc` is
present and **exits 3** with guidance when Word is unavailable.)

### Choosing chunk shape / language

`merge_mode: prose` (default) packs each section's prose into one chunk — best for an
embedding/search corpus. `definitions` also folds code in (reference/spec docs). `lang`
fixes the enrichment language (`de` for an all-German corpus) or use `auto` for mixed.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `prepare:doc-to-docx` stuck pending | no runner matches `windows_runner_tags`; set `convert_legacy_doc: false` and convert locally, or register/tag a Windows+Word runner |
| prepare fails `exit 3` "Microsoft Word is not available" | the matched Windows runner has no Word installed — fix the runner or convert locally |
| prepare **hangs** then hits `timeout: 30m` | the runner isn't an interactive logged-in session (Word COM needs one), or a `.doc` is password-protected. Run the runner as a logged-in user (autologon), and unprotect protected docs. |
| `convert` fails on a file | a `.doc` slipped through unconverted (the converter rejects binary `.doc`), or `lint --strict` found block-severity residue — read `outbox/reports/` |
| `pip install` can't find `sdd-pipeline` | package not in the Nexus PyPI repo — publish it, or set `pipeline_install` to a `git+https` spec |
| (anything Nexus/image/pandoc related) | see the `python-nexus` troubleshooting table above — `docx-to-chunks` uses the same Nexus plumbing |

---

## Using `validate-skills` in *your* project

A skill repo includes the component and keeps its skills under `skills_dir` as
`<name>/SKILL.md`. That's it — no group variables needed if you bring your own image.

```yaml
# my-skills-repo/.gitlab-ci.yml
include:
  - component: $CI_SERVER_FQDN/<group>/ci-components/validate-skills@1.0.0
    inputs:
      skills_dir: ".claude/skills"     # default; also e.g. .github/skills, .agents/skills
```

On every merge request and default-branch push the `validate:skills` job checks each
`SKILL.md` and **fails the pipeline** on any malformed frontmatter, leaving a
`skill-validation-report.txt` artifact (30-day retention).

### Outside the Nexus org (no `NEXUS_*` variables)

`validate-skills` installs nothing, so it only needs a Python image. If your project isn't
in the org that defines `NEXUS_DOCKER_REGISTRY`, override `image` with any public one:

```yaml
    inputs:
      image: "python:3.11-slim"
```

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| job fails `no SKILL.md found under …` | `skills_dir` is wrong, or your skills aren't laid out as `<skills_dir>/<name>/SKILL.md`. Fix the path, or set `fail_on_empty: false` if an empty set is acceptable. |
| `'name: …' must equal the skill directory` | the `name:` in frontmatter doesn't match the folder name — rename one to match. |
| `invalid skill 'name: …'` | `name` must be lowercase letters/digits/hyphens, no leading/trailing/double hyphen, `<= 64` chars. |
| image pulls from Docker Hub / `401` | default `image` expects `NEXUS_DOCKER_REGISTRY`; outside the org set `image` to a public Python image (above). |

## Publishing / maintaining these components

This source is **scaffolded inside the `sdd-semantic-pipeline` repo** under
`gitlab/ci-component/` for review, but a CI/CD Catalog component must live in its **own**
GitLab project. To publish:

1. Create a GitLab project `<group>/ci-components` and push the **contents of this
   `gitlab/ci-component/` directory to its root** (so `templates/python-nexus/template.yml`,
   `templates/docx-to-chunks/template.yml`, and `templates/validate-skills/template.yml` sit
   under the repo root, and the `scripts/` dir alongside them).
2. Add a project description + this README, then **Settings → CI/CD → CI/CD Catalog
   resource → ON**.
3. Set the three `NEXUS_*` variables at the **group** level.
4. Push a branch / open an MR → the `component-selftest`, `docx-to-chunks-selftest`, and the
   self-included `validate:skills` jobs validate the components at `@$CI_COMMIT_SHA` (Nexus
   image, pandoc, a trivial install, a docx → chunks smoke test, and a SKILL.md check against
   the committed `templates/validate-skills/examples/skills` fixture). The Windows `prepare`
   stage can only be exercised on a tagged Windows+Word runner.
5. Tag a semver release (e.g. `1.0.0`) → the `release` job publishes it to the org Catalog.
   All three components share the repo's tag/version.
6. Bump consumers' `@<version>` deliberately when a component changes.

> This directory is **not** consumed by the `sdd-semantic-pipeline` pipeline — it is inert
> to that repo's CI, doc-health, lint, type, test, and packaging gates.
